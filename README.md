### Hi, I’m Gonzalo Bossetti

Software developer with a strong backend and DevOps background, focused on building reliable systems and improving how organizations work with data.

I studied at the [UTN](https://utn.edu.ar/es/) 

My professional experience includes Java development, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and Kubernetes-based deployments. I’m especially interested in roles that combine technical depth with a broader product and business perspective.


Currently working on a personal project aimed at improving data management and decision-making processes in local governments.

:books: I also love to investigate and write about incoming technologies and society, you can take a look if you want!!
